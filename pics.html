              <li>We only use the personal data that you provide to us for the purpose for which it is collected or a directly related purpose;</li></li>
              <li>We will not sell or pass your personal data to any other organisation without your knowledge (or consent, as required);</li>
              <li>We will always give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our communications;</li>
              <li>We take our obligations under the law seriously and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns;</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Personal Data Collected</h3>
            <p>When you register with GoodCity.HK we may ask you to provide the following personal data. Please note that it is mandatory for you to provide certain categories of personal data as specified at the time of collection.

            <ul>
              <li>at your request, or subject to your consent having been given, to deliver news, updates and invitations on our activities, programs, products, research and upcoming events;</li>
              <li>to respond to your enquiries or suggestions;</li>
              <li>to process feedback and to follow up with you on your enquiries;</li>
