# Helping those in need during COVID-19: Fighting local poverty issues that need your attention and support

Since the start of the pandemic, low-income households have been severely affected by the negative impact of COVID-19. As we continue to navigate our daily lives during the pandemic while slowly adjusting to a new normal, the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 has further highlighted the entrenched disparity of income, health, and educational opportunities. Our society's most vulnerable are suffering disproportionately as Hong Kong races to fight the spread of COVID-19’s wave after wave. With many low-paying jobs gone, parents and children are confined to cramped living spaces, while poor senior citizens are at heightened risk of exposure. Joblessness in Hong Kong has hit an all-time low since the start of January of this year to 7%, putting even more pressure on the government to roll out emergency measures. 

Similarly, when COVID-19 hit, schools had to close for health and safety. For children who live in a cramped apartment without access to computers or even the internet, virtual learning is impossible. With unemployment on the rise, those who live in small, crowded living quarters may also lack necessities such as fans and other essential electrical appliances. For families squeezed into one-room homes, doing all activities in the same cramped space can take a significant toll on physical health and mental wellbeing. 

## How can you help? 

Providing low-income families with essential home items can help alleviate some of their hardships further exacerbated by COVID-19. Donating old furniture, clothes, household items such as electrical appliances, and baby products can make a massive difference to those living in poverty. 

Donations can come in all shapes and sizes, and we value contributions both large and small from individuals, families, schools, and charitable organisations. When you give to an NGO or a charitable organisation, you help address critical social needs in our community, like poverty alleviation, helping bridge the digital divide, assisting the elderly, empowering people with disabilities, and more. Our mission in Hong Kong is to actively support the Social Welfare Department and a wide range of NGOs in providing help to individuals and families living in vulnerable circumstances. To further our goal of ‘connecting a world in need’, GoodCity has designed a specialised app where social workers and staff from different charity organisations can access our platform and request goods from us. 

Many global issues are on our radar, and we long to see change occur. But our own community in Hong Kong is equally important to us. Whether it's on an individual or organisational level, we do our best to provide goods to empower those in need, and with your help and support, our reach can be even stronger.

## Want to help relieve the economic burden of those living in poverty during COVID-19? 

Here at GoodCity, we can help place your goods with non-profit projects that need them. Whether they're essential health and safety items, or any other goods you, your company, or your organisation wants to donate, we can help! 

Operated by Crossroads Foundation, GoodCity facilitates the donation of goods and helping those in need since 1995. Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust since 2018, GoodCity has ensured that donated goods from all over Hong Kong have helped nearly 300 non-profit organisations, benefiting more than 150,000 people. 

Once you've submitted pictures of the items you want to donate, GoodCity's team of experienced volunteers will review your items based on the status, demand, and quantity. We will then notify you if your items are available for donation. GoodCity also provides a variety of logistics options to transport your donated goods. You can book a commercial van immediately from within our app or book a drop-off time at our headquarters in Tuen Muen if you have your own transport.
