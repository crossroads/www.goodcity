# Declutter your space: Find the joy of simplicity & the opportunity to help others

The concept of living a simple life while doing all we can do to help those in need sounds like an attractive idea to many. However, for those living in cosmopolitan cities where spending and accumulating belongings are the norm, the idea of decluttering and owning less becomes overwhelming when your living space is filled with clutter that is all made up of things that you don't need. Moreover, a cluttered home is not all that uncommon in Hong Kong. It's no secret that the tiny apartments in Hong Kong can quickly accumulate a lot in a short amount of time - especially with the rise of e-commerce where shopping has been made more convenient and accessible than ever. 

Learning how to declutter your living space, and as a by-product your mind as well, doesn't need to be difficult. The benefits of culling your cluttered space are numerous, whether they be having a clearer mind, having less to organize to less to stress about! However, today we want to focus on how decluttering your space can not only help simplify your lifestyle, but majorly benefit those who are living in vulnerable circumstances.

Many people think that decluttering is a method of tidying-up popularized by Marie Kondo around 2011. Her method involves you drastically discarding your possessions and throwing away useless furniture or items that you don’t use anymore. But in fact, people who have the tendency to hoard are not incapable of discarding the objects themselves. They are incapable of letting go of the memories or sentimental value behind the objects.

To live a simple life, it's important to understand the relationship and philosophy between material objects and your mind. Because behind every item that you cannot easily part with, there may be memories related to others. For example, furniture gifted by relatives, tokens of love from past romantic partners, gifts from friends, and more. These items have a lot of meaning and, even if they don’t add value to your life or serve you anymore, they can’t be easily given up.

This is not to say owning and holding onto possessions is unhealthy. It's not a bad thing for an item that you own to hold sentimental value, but these memories or important moments should not only be placed on the object when it's something that you no longer want or need.

However, instead of throwing out the items you've culled, a better solution would be donating your pre-loved items that are still in good condition to those in need. The world needs more people who care, and now more than ever before our world faces unprecedented challenges. By donating your pre-loved items you are helping individuals and families living in less than ideal circumstances.
