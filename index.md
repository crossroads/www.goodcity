    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Whether you've donated your goods to GoodCity before or are considering donating your gently used goods, find
      answers below to frequently asked questions.</p>
    <h3>What does GoodCity do?</h3>
    <p>We take in gently used donations of all kinds, and ensure that quality items donated to us through the goodwill
      of families, organisations and businesses are then distributed to individuals or organisations in need.</p>
    <h3>How is GoodCity different from other charities and NGO’s in Hong Kong?</h3>
    <p>GoodCity promotes generosity and giving through our charity donation app, where we connect people by facilitating
      the process of donation with the help of volunteers to review, receive, and process donations in Hong Kong.</p>
    <h3>Can you come to pick up my donation?</h3>
    <p>We ask our donors to deliver goods to us. In the past GoodCity was among the charities that collect items no
      matter where you were in Hong Kong. However, due to the overwhelming generosity and support we received from our
      community in Hong Kong, we no longer have enough volunteers that can pick up donations.</p>
