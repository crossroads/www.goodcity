# 3 Major Reasons Why You Should Donate Items You No Longer Need Before Moving

It’s no secret that our small apartments in Hong Kong can accumulate a lot over the years. And no matter your reason, moving is always troublesome and kind of a big ordeal. Not only do you have to choose a space that suits your needs, but you also have to consider furniture, decor, and last but not least the total cost of moving. This is where carefully culling your belongings and donating them comes into play. Donating items that no longer serve you to someone in need, is not only charitable, but it can also help you save money. Read on to find out the top three benefits of how donating your belonging before moving can help make your life easier.

## You cut down on moving expenses

Generally, the more items you have to move the more expensive your move will be. Most moving companies charge based on the weight of your belongings, and some even charge based on an hourly rate. The more things you have to move the longer it will take for the moving company to complete their task. And by donating household items that you don’t need or want anymore, means you’ll be cutting down on the weight and time of your move. Furthermore, if you donate the belongings you no longer want, you won't even need to rent a storage unit. While the prices of self-storage units aren't exorbitantly high, the costs do add up. Especially if you're a long-term renter. On top of saving expenses, decluttering, and then donating excess belongings gives you an excuse to start fresh in a way that doesn't harm the environment, which brings us to our next point. 

## You get a chance to completely revamp your new space 

Frustrated that it takes you ages to find just one thing? Clutter around your space creates chaos. Donating furniture and household items you no longer need will make it easier to find items you use daily, as well as stop you from constantly tripping over cords and other hazardous items. Moreover, when you donate items you no longer need, you also get a chance to transform your messy surrounding into a more relaxing space. If you’re looking to revamp your space but aren’t sure where to start, donating common household items such as living room furniture and electrical appliances to charity organizations or NGOs accepting donations is a great starting point. Additionally, if you’re looking to sell or rent out your home, donating excess items will help interested buyers or renters focus on your space instead of the clutter around it, making it easier to sell or rent out. Moreover, a clean and organized space will appear more welcoming. 

## You can help those in need

By donating your clothes and household items to a reputable charity organization, you are also helping those in need. From seasonal clothes, kid’s toys, books to more common electrical appliances such as rice cookers, electric fans, and heaters, your hand-me-downs are particularly useful for the families who are in need. Not sure where to donate your items? 

An experienced charity organization, such as GoodCity operated by the Crossroads Foundation has facilitated the donation of goods and helping those in need since 1995. Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust since 2018, GoodCity has ensured that donated goods from all over Hong Kong have helped nearly 300 non-profit organizations, benefiting more than 150,000 people. 

Once you’ve submitted a picture of the item you wish to donate, GoodCity’s team of experienced volunteers will review your item and make a decision based on the status, demand, quantity, etc. of the items, before letting you know whether the item you wish to donate can help others. On top of that, GoodCity also provides a variety of logistics options, allowing you to choose a suitable transportation method for your donated goods. You can book a commercial van immediately from within our app, or if you've got your own transport you can book a time to drop your items off at our headquarter in Tuen Mun.
