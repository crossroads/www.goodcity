# Personal Information Collection Statement

Crossroads Foundation is committed to protecting the confidentiality and security of the personal data that we collect in the course of our activities, including through the GoodCity.HK website at www.goodcity.hk ("we", "us", "our", "Crossroads" and "GoodCity.HK")

This Personal Information Collection Statement (PICS) outlines our policies and practices with respect to the personal data you may be asked to provide when you register to receive items through GoodCity.HK. Our full privacy policy is available to view [here](https://www.crossroads.org.hk/home/contact/privacy)

We pledge to comply with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance in Hong Kong. We may change this PICS or our privacy policy from time to time by updating and re-posting them here. Your continued use of GoodCity.HK will mean that you accept these changes.

If you are under 18 years old, please ask your parents or guardian before using GoodCity.HK.

### Our Commitment to You

- We only use the personal data that you provide to us for the purpose for which it is collected or a directly related purpose;
- We will not sell or pass your personal data to any other organisation without your knowledge (or consent, as required);
- We will always give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our communications;
- We take our obligations under the law seriously and want to hear from you if you have any questions or concerns;

### Personal Data Collected
When you register with GoodCity.HK we may ask you to provide the following personal data.

Without this data we may not be able to provide you with our products and services:

- your gender and date of birth;
- financial information such as credit card information (if you make a payment to us) and bank account details (if we are making payment to you by direct debit);

- your responses to surveys or feedback.

### Purpose and Use
  
We may use the personal data that you provide to us for the following purposes and purposes directly related to them:

- at your request, or subject to your consent having been given, to deliver news, updates and invitations on our activities, programs, products, research and upcoming events;
- to respond to your enquiries or suggestions;

- to prevent or detect a crime or possible criminal activity.

### Third Parties

We may retain other organisations and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as our logistics partner GoGoVan. Such third parties may be provided with access to such of your personal data as needed to perform their functions, but we do not authorise them to use that data for any other purpose. Those third parties may be located outside Hong Kong. Our policy is to select reputable service providers who have the technical competence and organisational measures to meet our needs and who have a good track record on data protection.

If you have been referred by an organisation (such as the Social Welfare Department or another organisation), we may need to discuss your case with them and accordingly there will be a disclosure or transfer of your personal data as part of this process.

### Crossroads Network

Crossroads operates on a global basis. We have offices in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. We refer to this as the "Crossroads Network". We may disclose, share and transfer your personal data within the Crossroads Network for the purposes set forth in this PICS. We require those in the Crossroads Network to adhere to the procedures of data security and confidentiality as set out in this PICS and our privacy policy.

### Access and Correction of Personal Data

You have the right to review and correct personal data given to us. If the process of reviewing or correcting your personal data incurs any costs, we may charge you a reasonable fee to do this. Should you wish to review or correct personal data or if you have any questions regarding this PICS or our privacy policy please contact us at privacy@crossroads.org.hk
