# Top items that can make a difference in the quality of life of low-income families

Whether they are disadvantaged or low-income-adults and children who are living in poverty often lack necessities and access to essential resources needed to navigate day-to-day life. More than ever, those from low-income families in our community and beyond face unprecedented challenges during these uncertain times. Fortunately, you can help them thrive by providing them with essential items that all adults, children, and the elderly need. 

Donations come in all shapes and sizes and we value contributions both large and small—from individuals, families, schools and charitable organisations. When you give to an NGO or a charitable organisation you are helping address important social needs in our community such as poverty alleviation, helping bridge the digital divide, assisting the elderly, empowering people with disabilities, environmental conservation and more. Read on to find out which items you can donate that will make a difference in the quality of life of low-income families. 
 
## Furniture 

Unfortunately, furniture is often seen as a luxury for low-income families. Since they must avoid unnecessary expenditure to save money, a lot of low-income households only have a bed and the bare minimum furniture. One of the best ways to help a charitable organisation is to donate used furniture from your home or office that you no longer need. While you could recycle your well-loved furniture that are still in good condition, your hand-me-down furniture are particularly helpful for low-income families who need a bed or a desk that they cannot afford. 

## Electronics 

Electrical appliances such as rice cookers, fans, induction stovetops and electric kettles are considered a necessity for many. But for low-income families, they are considered luxury items. The same goes for mobile phones and laptops. By donating your old electronics that are still in good condition - such as a laptop or smartphone- can not only provide adults and children living in poverty a better quality of life, but also the opportunity to support their educational and job training aspirations.

## Baby products 

A number of low-income families find themselves in a situation where they find difficulty or no way of getting essential baby items such as baby bassinets, prams, cots, sterilisers, clothing, bedding, nappies and many more items. Moreover, many families facing financial difficulties find themselves unable to access or afford clean, safe baby and child items and might even have to take the risk of using unsafe baby and child items if that is all they can obtain. By donating gently used, pre-loved baby and child items to families in need within their local community and city will make a positive change in those families lives by providing them with essentials while encouraging recycling and waste minimisation.

## Looking for a charitable organisation to donate your items? 

A reputable charity organisation, such as GoodCity operated by the Crossroads Foundation has facilitated the donation of goods and helping those in need since 1995. Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust since 2018, GoodCity has ensured that donated goods from all over Hong Kong have helped nearly 300 non-profit organisations, benefiting more than 150,000 people. 

Once you’ve submitted a picture of the item you wish to donate, GoodCity’s team of experienced volunteers will review your item and make a decision based on the status, demand, quantity, etc. of the items. They will then let you know whether the item you wish to donate can help others. On top of that, GoodCity also provides a variety of logistics options, allowing you to choose a suitable transportation method for your donated goods. You can book a commercial van immediately from within our app, or if you've got your own transport, book a time to drop your items off at our headquarters in Tuen Mun.
